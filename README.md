# Air-Canvas-Using-Mediapipe

This is a fun project made with Python where I have used the following libraries: numpy, cv2 and mediapipe.


# 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗔𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀:

- Hand/Finger Tracking: The system uses computer vision techniques to detect and track hand movements. With MediaPipe and OpenCV, it identifies key points (typically the index fingertip) to determine the drawing position. 

- Real-Time Drawing: Movements captured from a webcam are mapped to a virtual canvas, where interpolation techniques connect the dots for smooth drawing. 

- Interactivity: Users can change brush colors, adjust brush size, and clear the canvas—all without physical contact. This hands-free approach opens up possibilities for creative expression, educational tools, and even augmented reality applications 



# 𝗙𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗘𝗻𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀:

- AI-Powered Gesture Recognition: Use deep learning models for more advanced and customizable gestures. 

- Multi-Touch & Multi-User Support: Allow multiple users to interact with the same canvas. 

- Mobile App Development: Implement in smartphones/tablets using TensorFlow Lite. 

- Cloud-Based Storage: Save and share drawings easily via cloud integration.
